# Practical Python Examples

Some examples of code that can be used to automate day-to-day tasks.

These are all works-in-progress as of **2024-12-04**. I've put together the working code within the notebooks, but most of them need more inline comments and markdown blurb.

- Lifting data from a formatted spreadsheet and arranging it into neat columns for export as a .csv
- Processing data from multiple spreadsheets.

- Extracting data from the Fingertips using the *fingertips_py* package (uses the Fingertips API).

# Data

All of the data used in the examples is Public NHS England data, typically from Fingertips and regular NHS published datasets.
